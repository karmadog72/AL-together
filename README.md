Hello with this project our group has tackled the mission of helping people with memory loss using a website 

With the website you can have it help you with all types of daily task such as If you've eaten, If you've done all your daily hygiene routines, Which meds to take at which times, And a contact list of important people in your life that help take care of you.

Within this project we used HTML CSS JavaScript and CSS library 'Bulma' we also used 'Jquery' for a JavaScript library along side that we included MomentJs to help with time Finally we included 2 API's. 1 being a COVID API to keep the user updated with the current active cases in the US. The other API is a weather so that the user can have the ease of checking the weather on the landing page.
